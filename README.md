MIDI drum machine
------------------
* uses CC input (CC1-CC5) from LPD8 affecting patterns stored in settings.json
* output to you favorite DAW through loopbe1 (http://nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html)

TODO:
------------------
Would be nice to add other CCs for:
* tempo
* shuffle
* manipulating base velocity array, probability array
* random salt amount for more realistic shuffle

Blinkenlights feedback

Some time in the future:
* socket.io with sliders/gauges to show pattern arrays and current multiplier settings
